I saw an [interesting tweet](https://twitter.com/jagarikin/status/894452278463053824) that was describing how to make an 2D animation of a flame burning, so decided to implement the same thing in JS and show the flame on a web page.

Here's the code:

And here's what it looks like:

I first implemented in a very ordinary way which was to have a matrix data object with random numbers in each rows and cells, and then randomly change the very bottom row and trigger the rest of the rows to update its value upon it. The code was concise and it moved as I expected, however, the animation started get unbelievably slow after a few seconds. I used `setInterval` to perform a infinite loop so that the flame will always be moving around, but for some reason this was clogging the UI thread and other updates to the virtual DOM of the Vue.js instances. Then I thought of passing around the Vue instances among each other and let individual cell components handle the update, which made the implementation fairy ugly, yet managed to keep the animation performance acceptable.

I believe there's a better way of solving this issue, perhaps using `requestAnimationFrame` or other related APIs might work. I never was so passionate about animations, but maybe it's a good chance to look into it a bit more.
