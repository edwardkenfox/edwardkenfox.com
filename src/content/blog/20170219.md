I've completely renewed my site [edwardkenfox.com](http://edwardkenfox.com). Here's what I did:

- Renew page content
- Build static HTML with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [cocoa](http://themes.gohugo.io/cocoa/) theme.
- Serve pages with [h2o](https://h2o.examp1e.net)
- Use HTTPS (wip)
- Manage h2o & hugo environment with Docker
- Run h2o on Docker on AWS EC2

You can see all of this done in a single repository from my GitHub repo [edwardkenfox/edwardkenfox.com](https://github.com/edwardkenfox/edwardkenfox.com), everything except for EC2 configurations. I will cover the details of this renewal more precisely in a later post.
