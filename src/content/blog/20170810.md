The development status of Service Worker had changed from `Under consideration` to `In development` a few days ago, and seems like a lot of people are getting really excited about it.

Although it will certainly take some time for WebKit to actually have Service Workers up and running, but it's good to see this finally happening. What I wonder is how the WebKit team at Apple thinks about PWA, whether they see it as a threat or rather a opportunity.
