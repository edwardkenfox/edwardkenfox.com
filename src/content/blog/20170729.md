Soon after I posted my [earlier post](https://edwardkenfox.com/blog/emojis-and-maxlength-attribute/) about emojis and `maxlength` behavior, I received an reply to the issue about how Chrome handles it. It said that:

-   Chromium implement the `maxlength` functionality according to the specifications
-   There is relevant discussion going on as a specifications issue [here](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/1467)

The issue on whatwg/html starts as how line breaks should be counted for `maxlength`, but also spans to different related topics. The interest thing I didn't know is that even non-BMP characters are counted as 1 on `maxlength` with Safari and Edge/IE, which I tried myself and this was true. So rather than specification itself, the primary problem seems to be the compatibility between major browsers whether it should be counted based on its code-unit or code-point.

I've been looking at this problem fundamentally as a front-end matter, but some people were giving insights from back-end aspect, more precisely, database point of view, seeing `maxlength` as a byte length validation, which is something I never thought of. The whole discussion was pretty interesting, but it didn't seem like all parties settled down to a consensus. However, seeing [this commit](https://github.com/whatwg/html/commit/0943138dbe5ee15ce671a905bad1ef2986a03a11) to the whatwg/html repo, the conclusion as a spec is:

-   line breaks should be counted as 1
-   value should be counted by its code-point- length
