A couple weeks ago I got a chance to attend [I/O Extended 2018 Tokyo@GDG](https://gdg-tokyo.connpass.com/event/84164/) and gave did a LT session with the title "Post-Evolution state of the web." I was originally just going to attend the event, but discovered they had a LT slot open so decided to take it. My LT was about the impression that I felt through my first attendance of Google I/O mostly focused on web and browser technologies. The slide deck is [here](https://speakerdeck.com/edwardkenfox/post-evolution-state-of-the-web), take a look if you're interested.
