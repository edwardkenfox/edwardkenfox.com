I was working on a project that had been using [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com) for collecting system metrics and firing alerts based on them. Datadog is a great service to do this if you precisely know the granularity of the data you wish to have, especially good to aggregate all kinds of container based metrics, but it had a trivial problem with its metric API which I happened to encounter after a while using it: the API server occasionally returns response with status code 500 (internal server error), which is perfectly acceptable, but even if the request had been sent as `Content-Type: application/json`, the response would always be `Content-Type: text/html`, obviously returning 500 erro HTML file as its body which made me wonder how a server should take care of internal errors.

OK, I admit that I've done this kind of thing myself when working on an API server implementation. I assume that this behavior happens for two possible reasons: 1) the reverse proxy server handles all kinds of errors that occur in its origin server and returns approproate static HTML error file, or 2) the response is generated in the origin server. Yet, in both cases, it seems to me that fixing this issue is as simple as adding a few lines of conditional blocks to return error response body in either HTML or JSON or whatever depending on the request's `Content-Type` or `Accept` header. But then, my next thought was that "The server obviously had an internal error, so in such case does the server still have the responsibility to respond to the request in the requested format, or rather the client should be prepared for such circumstance?"


I was using the [dogapi](https://github.com/DataDog/dogapi-rb) gem, which is the client library to send metric data to Datadog's API server from a ruby program or a rails application, and found the error message in above situation (getting HTML response due to a 500 error on DD's server) was not communicating well of what happened, so submitted a PR for this, yet, still thinking which one of the client or the server, or perhaps both, should be responsible for handling such situation. Drop me a comment if you have any thoughts on this!
